1. Always decompose complex UI into smaller, reusable widgets.
2. Prefer creating dedicated widget classes (StatelessWidget/StatefulWidget) over inline functions.
3. Avoid using helper functions inside build() to return parts of the UI (e.g., Widget _buildHeader()).
4. Avoid large monolithic widgets with nested Row/Column/Stack without decomposition.
5. Move user interaction logic (e.g., onPressed, onTap) outside the UI layer
6. Use controllers (Bloc) or dedicated classes to manage actions
7. Avoid writing business logic directly in callbacks inside build()
8. Avoid inline anonymous functions with complex logic (e.g., onPressed: () { ... })
